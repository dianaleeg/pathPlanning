function path = SFC_trajGen(start, end, polys)
%SFC_TRAJGEN Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here


% load start, end points

% load polygons
polys{1} = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6];
polys{2} = [7 8; 9 10; 11 12; 13 14];

% perform unions using https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/polyshape.union.html

% extract vertecies of unioned polygons

% grid points within unions or figure out how to bound minimum snap

% cycle through all points and calculate minimum snap on each

% choose shortest minimum snap

% use as path

end
